## Not So Basic Solidworks

In my Not So Basic Solidwokrs folder I have two folders titled Sweeps&Lofts and aLittlePractice.

In Sweeps&Lofts I have two small projects; GenieBottle and Hammer. The GenieBottle uses sweeps and the Hammer uses lofts.

In aLittlePractice I made the project A pratcice pasrts 1 and 2, in this I made a box and then on pasrt 2 I made the lid which required a hole in the top, I also had to change the materials for the top.

A little Practice pt.2

The purpose of this assignment was to give practice and review of many basic skills and tools that are needed/ used a lot in SolidWorks.
Part 2 of this assingment was to manly teach how to assemble parts.





Some lessions I learned was that the hollowing out the top part was rather hard and asking for help would've made the prosess a lot easier. 
Think twice is very important   while assembling because linning up all the planes and points can be tricky.

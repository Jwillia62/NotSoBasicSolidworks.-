GenieBottle

The assignment is to make a candle stick looking thing, which teaches you how to make sweeps on SolidWorks. 

How to build

The lessions I learned while making the GenieBottle is to look closely at the pictures they give you and read what they are saying,
and to read closly. I also should have also probably asked for help sooner before I spent a long time trying to figure out where
the buttons where.

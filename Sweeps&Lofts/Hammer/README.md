Hammer

The assignment's purpose was to make a hammer head and teach how to make a loft. The hook/back side of the hammer required a
lofted cut. "Loft cut is a Solidworks features tool which helps to cut or remove materials between two or more profiles."-solidworkstutorialsforbeginners.com â€º solidworks-loft-cut-features


End Result:


The lessions I learned while making this was actual knowing how to loft cut instead of getting lucky on the 10th try.
I also should've planned more while making my filets.
